# docker-support
A repository that will contain any support scripts that I will use for containers.

## Scope
A couple of scripts that should be installed into a container's $PATH/ for simplifying a few vaguely annoying repetitive tasks.

### test_perm
This generally isn't intended to be run directly however there is no real reason you couldn't but its not it's intent and won't generally be supported.

### test_for_dir
This tests a directories permissions and adjusts them if they aren't as defined by the user or scripts executing it.

### test_for_file
This tests a files permissions and adjusts them if they aren't as defined by the user or scripts executing it.
